/*
Write a program to create a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should ask for two numbers (floating point) and perform all the operations
Hint => 
Create a variable number1 and number 2 and take user inputs.
Perform Arithmetic Operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and assign the result to a variable and finally print the result
I/P => number1, number2
O/P => The addition, subtraction, multiplication and division value of 2 numbers ___ and ___ is ___, ____, ____, and ___
*/

 ## Day 6 – Scenario based problems
---
**Date**: 10 Jan 2026
Questions:

- BookShelf – Library Organizer (HashMap + Linked List)
Story: In a library system, books are arranged based on genre and author. A HashMap maps genre → list of books (LinkedList). Each list is dynamically updated when books are borrowed or returned.

- BrowserBuddy – Tab History Manager (Doubly Linked List + Stack)
Story: Neha is working on a custom browser. Each open tab maintains its browsing history with "Back" and "Forward" operations. She uses a Doubly Linked List for history and a Stack to hold closed tabs for reopening.

-  AmbulanceRoute – Emergency Patient Navigation (Circular Linked List)
Story: In a hospital, there are multiple buildings connected in a circular fashion:
Emergency → Radiology → Surgery → ICU → Emergency. When an ambulance is bringing in patients, it follows a Circular Linked List to decide the nearest available unit for emergency treatment.

# Week 3: Scenario Based Problems
***
## Day 1 – Scenario Based Problems
---
**Date**: 12 Jan 2026
Questions:

- CallCenter – Customer Queue Manager (Queue + HashMap)
Story: In a telecom call center, customers are queued based on the time of call. Priority
customers have a special queue. A HashMap keeps track of the number of times each user has
called this month.

- TrainCompanion – Compartment Navigation System (Doubly Linked
List)
Story: In a long-distance train app, passengers can walk to the next or previous compartment,
or search for services (like pantry, WiFi). Each compartment is a node in a Doubly Linked List.

- TextEditor – Undo/Redo Functionality (Stack)
Story: Shanaya is building a basic text editor app. Every action (insert, delete, format) is
pushed onto a Stack. An Undo action pops from the stack, and Redo uses another stack to
reapply actions.

- TrafficManager – Roundabout Vehicle Flow (Circular Linked List +
Queue)
Story: A smart city roundabout allows vehicles to enter and exit dynamically. Each vehicle is a
node in a Circular Linked List. A Queue manages vehicles waiting to enter.

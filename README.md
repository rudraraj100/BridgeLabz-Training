📌 Overview

This repository documents my learning journey through Git, GitHub, Core Java, Scenario-Based Problem Solving, Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Data Structure algorithm(DSA).
It showcases consistent hands-on practice, logical thinking, and real-world problem-solving using Java.

### Technologies & Tools Used

- Java
- Git & GitHub
- Command Line Interface (CLI)

 Learning Breakdown

## Week 1 – Git, GitHub & Java Fundamentals

- Git installation and GitHub setup
- Branching and version control workflow

## Lifestyle application(Branch java-oops-practice)

-  "LoanBuddy – Loan Approval Automation"
Story: A fintech startup named FinlyTech is launching a product called LoanBuddy, a web and
mobile app that automates personal loan approvals for salaried and self-employed applicants.
LoanBuddy should collect applicant data, verify eligibility, evaluate credit risk, and either
approve or reject the loan based on custom rules. It also calculates monthly EMIs and provides
a personalized repayment plan.

-  "BookBazaar – Digital Bookstore System"
Story: You’re building the backend for BookBazaar, an online bookstore. It must handle book
inventory, orders, and discounts.

- "ParkEase – Smart Parking Management System"
Story: A city wants a smart parking solution that can assign parking slots, calculate charges,
and track availability in real time.

📌 Overview

This repository documents my learning journey through Git, GitHub, Core Java, Scenario-Based Problem Solving, Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Data Structure algorithm(DSA).
It showcases consistent hands-on practice, logical thinking, and real-world problem-solving using Java.

### Technologies & Tools Used

- Java
- Git & GitHub
- Command Line Interface (CLI)

 Learning Breakdown

## Week 1 – Git, GitHub & Java Fundamentals

Git installation and GitHub setup
Branching and version control workflow
Java basics: syntax, programming elements
Control flow statements and loops
Arrays and problem-solving
Methods and reusable logic

Focus: Strong foundation in Java and Git

## Week 2 – Strings & Extras
--- 

String concepts and immutability
Built-in string methods
Exception handling basics
Tabular output formatting
Date & Time APIs (LocalDate, LocalTime)

Advanced string problems (anagram, frequency, substring)

Focus: Core Java depth and built-in utilities

## Week 3 – Scenario-Based Problems (SBQ)
--- 

Real-world Java applications using:
if-else, switch-case
loops (for, while, do-while)
arrays and user input 
Examples include:

- BMI Tracker
- Metro Smart Card System
- Election Booth Manager 
- Parking Lot System
- Train Reservation System
- Movie Ticket Booking App

Focus: Logic building & real-world simulations

## Day 22 – DSA Scenario Based Problems
---
**Date**: 15 Jan 2026

Questions:

- HospitalQueue – Patient Sorting by Criticality (Bubble Sort)
Story: At Apollo Hospital, patients in the ER are initially listed by arrival time. However, before
assigning beds, the staff wants to sort them by criticality level (1–10). Since the list is usually
small (10–20 patients), Bubble Sort is used to quickly sort patients in-place without using extra
memory.

- SmartShelf – Real-Time Book Arrangement (Insertion Sort)
Story: In a digital library kiosk, as users add books to their reading list, the system must keep
the list sorted alphabetically by title. Since books are added one at a time and the list is
mostly sorted, Insertion Sort fits perfectly.

- ZipZipMart – Daily Sales Summary Report (Merge Sort)
Story: ZipZipMart compiles thousands of daily sales records from all branches. To generate
reports, the system sorts transactions by date and amount using Merge Sort, which ensures
stability and efficiency with large datasets.

- EventManager – Ticket Price Optimizer (Quick Sort)
Story: An event booking portal sorts millions of tickets by price before showing the top 50
cheapest or most expensive. Since speed is crucial and data is unsorted, Quick Sort is used for
its average-case performance.

- ExamCell – Student Rank Generator (Merge Sort)
Story: An online exam system collects scores from multiple test centers. To publish a
state-level rank list, student scores are merged and sorted using Merge Sort, ensuring
performance and accuracy.

Solution: [Files](https://github.com/rudraraj100/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/dsa-practice/java-dsa-practice/scenario-based/JavaDSAScenario/src/com/day4) 

## Day 23 – DSA Scenario Based Problems
---
**Date**: 16 Jan 2026

Questions:

- RoboWarehouse – Shelf Loading Robot (Insertion Sort)
Story: A robot loads packages onto shelves based on weight. It adds one package at a time
and must maintain an ascending order by weight for balance. Insertion Sort helps since new
items are inserted into the sorted list dynamically.

- CinemaHouse – Movie Time Sorting (Bubble Sort)
Story: A small local cinema lists daily movie shows. The screen manager updates showtimes
manually and prefers a simple sorting logic. Since the number of shows is small (~10), Bubble
Sort is used.

- CropMonitor – Sensor Data Ordering (Quick Sort)
Story: An agri-tech firm uses drone sensors that record soil temperatures at random intervals.
The large data needs to be sorted quickly by timestamp before visualization. Quick Sort is
chosen due to its fast average performance.

Solution: [Files](https://github.com/rudraraj100/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/dsa-practice/java-dsa-practice/scenario-based/JavaDSAScenario/src/com/day5) 

## Day 24 – DSA and OOPS Scenario Based Problems
---
**Date**: 17 Jan 2026

Questions: dsa sceanrio based

- FleetManager – Vehicle Maintenance Scheduler (Merge Sort)
Story: A fleet company schedules vehicle maintenance based on mileage. Each depot sends a
sorted list of vehicles. To create a master schedule, Merge Sort is used to combine these depot
lists efficiently.

- ArtExpo – Sort Artists by Registration Time (Insertion Sort)
Story: At an art exhibition, artists register throughout the day. The system continuously adds
each entry and maintains a sorted list by registration time for booth assignment. Insertion Sort
fits well due to the incremental nature.

- IceCreamRush – Sorting Flavors by Popularity (Bubble Sort)
Story: At “IceCreamRush,” a small local vendor sells 8 different ice cream flavors. At the end of
each week, the shopkeeper wants to sort these flavors based on how many times each was
sold. Since the list is short and he updates it manually, he prefers a simple sorting method —
Bubble Sort — where he repeatedly compares adjacent sales figures and swaps them if
Needed.

- SmartLibrary – Auto-Sort Borrowed Books (Insertion Sort)
Story: A digital kiosk in a library maintains a list of books a user has borrowed. Every time a
new book is issued, the system adds it to the user's list while keeping it alphabetically sorted
by title. Since insertions are done one at a time, and the list is usually already sorted, Insertion
Sort is the perfect fit.

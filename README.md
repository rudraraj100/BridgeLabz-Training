- AmbulanceRoute – Emergency Patient Navigation (Circular Linked List)
Story: In a hospital, there are multiple buildings connected in a circular fashion:
Emergency → Radiology → Surgery → ICU → Emergency. When an ambulance is bringing in patients, it follows a Circular Linked List to decide the nearest available unit for emergency treatment.

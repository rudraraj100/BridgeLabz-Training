 ## Day 5 – Scenario based problems
---
**Date**: 10 Jan 2026
Questions:

- BookShelf – Library Organizer (HashMap + Linked List)
Story: In a library system, books are arranged based on genre and author. A HashMap maps genre → list of books (LinkedList). Each list is dynamically updated when books are borrowed or returned.

- BrowserBuddy – Tab History Manager (Doubly Linked List + Stack)
Story: Neha is working on a custom browser. Each open tab maintains its browsing history with "Back" and "Forward" operations. She uses a Doubly Linked List for history and a Stack to hold closed tabs for reopening.

-  AmbulanceRoute – Emergency Patient Navigation (Circular Linked List)
Story: In a hospital, there are multiple buildings connected in a circular fashion:
Emergency → Radiology → Surgery → ICU → Emergency. When an ambulance is bringing in patients, it follows a Circular Linked List to decide the nearest available unit for emergency treatment.
